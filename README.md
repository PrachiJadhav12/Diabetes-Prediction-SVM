# Diabetes-Prediction-SVM
Diabetes Prediction using SVM
This project predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, and the model achieves 77% accuracy on test data.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can **predict diabetes** in patients using basic health metrics. This prediction task is important for early detection and prevention of long-term health complications due to diabetes.

We use a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — a supervised classification algorithm known for its effectiveness on small- to medium-sized datasets. The model is trained using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes health-related variables such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin level, and more.

Key highlights:

* **No Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is included — this project is focused purely on **model training and evaluation**.
* **Data preprocessing** is limited to basic steps like train-test splitting and scaling.
* The SVM model is trained using **scikit-learn** with default or basic hyperparameters.
* The final model achieves **77% accuracy** on the test dataset, indicating a reasonable level of performance for a baseline model.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be quickly applied to a healthcare problem with minimal processing and still produce useful insights.
